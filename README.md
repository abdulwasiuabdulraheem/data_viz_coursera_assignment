# interactive-visualizations-coursera-assignment


In this peer review assignment, I created interactive visualizations of US domestic airline flights performance. 

The goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability and, ultimately, improving customer reliability.

The assignment questions and solutions can be found in the file named 'data_viz_with_python_assignment.ipynb'.
