# data_viz_coursera_assignment

In this peer review assignment, I wrote python codes to create interactive visualizations of US domestic airline flights performance. 

The goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability and, ultimately, improving customer reliability.

The assignment questions and solutions can be found in the file named 'data_viz_with_python_assignment.ipynb'.
